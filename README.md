# Online-Food-Ordering-System-v1.0
This is my Personal Learning Project, created as part of my self-study journey to improve my Business Analysis skills. In this version 1.0, there are still many potential features that have not yet been implemented, numerous aspects that still need improvement. A more complete and refined version is expected to be released in the future.

Background: 
PM - Project Manager is asking you (BA - Business Analyst) to write detailed descriptions for important feature groups of the food delivery app that your team is developing: 

Actor: User (Customer)
- Search and select food
- Order and pay
- Track order

Actor: Restaurant
- Manage menu items
- Confirm order
- Update order status

This app is similar to GrabFood, Baemin, or ShopeeFood, so you can imagine their familiar features.
